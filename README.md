# Xpeawey
## About me
I, Xpeawey, am a 14 year old STUDENT who is interested in IT programming. Why did I choose IT and not games? It's simple! When I was 11 years old I liked to sit in discord and tried to create my own server and tried to configure discord bots (JuniperBot, Mee6, Rythm, ProBot). After a while I wondered: How can I create my own bot? After searching for resources and YouTube I realized that it is difficult to create discord bots, but it didn't stop me. At the age of 12 I wrote my first bot (GamerBot). I was VERY interested in programming and wanted to learn more and more. For 1 month and wrote little discord bots. Why 1 month? Because I gave up on it, but soon I came back. At almost 13 years old I already knew how to write discord bots and decided to learn telegram API. The API seemed to be easy to me and I still continued to write code and explore new areas of IT. Here I am 14 and I know how to use discord, telegram API. I know: Python, JS, C#, html, css. I'm studying: Java, C++. I want to learn: Assembler.
### Why Xpeawey?
I was 13 years old. I had a Discord account. I had the most common nickname (zagir1), But everything changed! I got the idea (yes I have it): To make up my own discord nickname. After an hour I got my favorite nickname Xpeawey, but now I'm thinking to change it to Weet.
